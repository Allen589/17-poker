# 17-poker
From the 17 card poker game on "Liar game."


Based on the Korean television show, and Japanese manga, "17 Card Poker" is played with 17 cards,
1 joker, 4 queens, 4 kings, 4 jacks, 4 aces. The Joker is a wildcard and represents a card that gives you
the best hand (if you have 4 aces, then the joker turns into an ace).
The hand strength ranks are listed in order below: 
Five of a Kind
Four of a Kind
Full House
Three of a Kind
Two Pairs
One Pair

The game starts with the player and dealer being dealt 5 cards in alternating order. The player gets a chance
to cut the game deck (send n number of cards to the bottom of the deck). Then, the player has the option to 
swap cards (choose up to 5 cards from his own deck, and send it to the bottom of the game deck, in exchange for 
the corresponding amount of cards on the top of the game deck). The dealer then gets a chance to swap cards.
Afterwards, the cards are evaluated and the winner is decided.

Note: this is an alternate and simplified version of the game.

This is currently a work in progress. Not all methods have been implemented yet.
